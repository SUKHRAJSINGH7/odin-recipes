    <ol>In large bowl, beat eggs, green chiles, salt and pepper until well blended. In same skillet over medium-high heat, cook sausage 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned. Stir in egg mixture; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until scrambled.</ol>  
    <ol>To assemble burritos, spoon line of hash browns down center of each tortilla. Top with cheese and egg mixture.</ol>
    <ol>Roll up each tortilla tightly to secure filling. Serve immediately, or freeze as directed below.</ol>
