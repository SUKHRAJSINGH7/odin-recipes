    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marinating is the process of soaking foods in a seasoned, often acidic, liquid before cooking. The origin of the word alludes to the use of brine (aqua marina or sea water) in the pickling process, which led to the technique of adding flavor by immersion in liquid.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1/3 cup soy sauce</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1/3 cup fresh lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</ul>
    <ul>1 and half tablespoon garlic powder</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons dried basil</ul>
    <ul>1 and half tablespoons dried parsley flakes</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</ul>
    <ul>1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon dried minced garlic</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Place the soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, basil, parsley, and pepper in a blender. Add hot pepper sauce and garlic, if desired. Blend on high speed for 30 seconds until thoroughly mixed.</li>
    <li>Pour marinade over desired type of meat. Cover, and refrigerate for up to 8 hours. Cook meat as desired.</li>
